To provide you with a comprehensive understanding of CSS code, I will break it down into different sections:

CSS Basics: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used to style and layout web pages. To use CSS, you need to create a separate .css file or include the CSS code within the HTML file.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
/* styles.css */
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 24px;
}

p {
  color: green;
  font-size: 16px;
}
Selectors: In CSS, selectors are used to target specific HTML elements. You can select elements by their tag name, class, or ID.
/* Select by element */
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 24px;
}

/* Select by class */
.important {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* Select by ID */
#main-content {
  background-color: lightgrey;
}
CSS Properties and Values: CSS properties control various aspects of an element’s appearance, such as color, font, size, spacing, and positioning.
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  color: green;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
CSS Inheritance and Cascade: CSS styles are inherited from parent elements to child elements. The cascade determines how conflicting styles are resolved based on their specificity and order of appearance in the stylesheet.
CSS Layout Techniques: CSS offers various layout techniques to create responsive and flexible web layouts. These include floats, flexbox, and grid layout.
/* Flexbox example */
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.container div {
  flex-basis: 30%;
  padding: 20px;
}

/* Grid layout example */
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 20px;
}

.grid-container div {
  padding: 20px;
}
Responsive Design: CSS media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the device’
